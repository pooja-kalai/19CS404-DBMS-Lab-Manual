# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Member — Join — Program**          | M : 1                                  | Member (optional), Program (mandatory)      | A member can join multiple programs; a program has many members.                |

| **Member — Books — Session**         | M : M                                  | Optional for both                           | Members can book multiple sessions; sessions can be booked by many members.     |
| **Member — Make — Payment**          | 1 : M                                  | Member (mandatory), Payment (mandatory)     | Each payment belongs to one member; members can make multiple payments.         |

### Assumptions
A session is always conducted by one trainer.

Members can join zero or many programs.

A program must have a trainer assigned (based on diagram’s participation).

A member may book sessions independently of joining programs.

Attendance is only recorded for booked sessions.

Payment does not depend on programs or sessions; a member simply makes payments.

Booking relationship between Member and Session is M:N but represented implicitly through Attendance (or could be a separate link table).

# Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

**Business Context:**  
The Central Library wants to manage book lending and cultural events.

**Requirements:**  
- Members borrow books, with loan and return dates tracked.  
- Each book has title, author, and category.  
- Library organizes events; members can register.  
- Each event has one or more speakers/authors.  
- Rooms are booked for events and study.  
- Overdue fines apply for late returns.

### Assumptions
Each loan is strictly linked to one book (not multiple books per loan).

A member can exist without creating loans or attending events.

Fines only exist if a loan has exceeded its expiry date.

Every event must be held in a room.

Author/Speaker is treated as its own entity, not part of Member.

Each event has one speaker, and each speaker conducts one event at a time.

Room availability indicates whether the room can host events.

A customer pays exactly one bill per reservation.

A dish cannot exist without belonging to a category.

A reservation can have zero or many orders.

Orders must belong to a reservation.

A table may be assigned to many reservations over time, but one reservation gets only one table.

Category names like starter/main/dessert are treated as attribute values, not entities.

### RESULT

The experiment has been executed successfully and the ER diagrams were designed for all the given scenarios.
The entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints were identified correctly.
Thus, the database models were created successfully for the real-world applicat
